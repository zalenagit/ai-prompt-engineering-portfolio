# AI Prompt Engineering Portfolio  
Created by Zalina Yusop  

This portfolio showcases my work in **prompt engineering**, **AI evaluation**, **LLM safety testing**, and **QA-style analysis for AI systems**.  
It is designed to demonstrate the skills required for remote roles such as:

- Prompt Engineer  
- AI Evaluator / Rater  
- AI Safety Analyst  
- AI QA Specialist  
- LLM Content & Quality Reviewer  

Each project highlights a different competency used in real-world AI workflows.
